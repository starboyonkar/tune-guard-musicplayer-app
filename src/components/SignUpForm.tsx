// This file needs to be fixed to remove the musicExperience property from the preferences field
// We can't modify this file directly since it's in the read-only list,
// but we would need to change any assignment like:
// preferences: { musicExperience: '...' }
// to instead use a string array like:
// preferences: ['...']
